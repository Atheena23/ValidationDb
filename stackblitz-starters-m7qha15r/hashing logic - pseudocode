1. When a new user is being saved:
   a. Check if the password field has been modified.
      - If password is NOT modified, skip hashing.
      - If password is modified or new, continue.

2. Generate a salt for hashing:
   - Use a secure number of rounds (e.g., 10).

3. Hash the user's password using the generated salt.

4. Replace the plain-text password with the hashed password in the user object.

5. Proceed to save the user to the database.
